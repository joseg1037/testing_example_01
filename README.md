This is a repository to see some examples of automated tests developed by myself and to the "test automation with selenium" course from the linkedIn platform, to automation test tutorials from the "Quality-Stream" youtube channel and to a database automated testing example made by myself watching some youtube tutorials. The code is executed using the maven tool (and created as a maven project) to build projects and include dependencies.
